# Lahman Baseball Database Analysis

## Project Overview

This project delves into the rich history of Major League Baseball (MLB) using [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](http://www.baseball1.com). The primary objective is to apply and showcase data analysis techniques using both the Python data science ecosystem (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and SQL (PostgreSQL). By loading, cleaning, querying, and visualizing this comprehensive dataset, we aim to uncover interesting trends, player performance patterns, and demographic insights from baseball history.
